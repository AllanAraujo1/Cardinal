# DISTRHO CVCRack

WORK IN PROGRESS - nothing to see here

Just an experiment to see how far we can go about a VCV plugin version that is opensource and uses original VCV source core directly.
Maybe it will work, maybe not, hard to say at this point.

This is a DPF'ied build of [VCVRack](https://github.com/VCVRack/Rack), allowing it to be used as an audio plugin.

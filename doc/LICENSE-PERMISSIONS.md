# LICENSE PERMISSIONS

A few panel graphics have uncertain license terms when it comes to redistribution and usage within Cardinal.
Cardinal authors have requested permission to the creators/owners of such graphics, for use and redistribution of the same.

This document gives details on such licenses where there is no online resource to directly link to (permission request happened via private chat or email).
Below follows a direct copy and paste of each individual request.
